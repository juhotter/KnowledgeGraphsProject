# KnowledgeGraphsProject
## Semester Project in Knowledge Graphs from Joey Hieronimy & Julian Hotter

### Dataset: https://www.yelp.com/dataset
The Yelp dataset typically includes datasets about businesses, user reviews, and other related data.
For our purpose, we use the dataset of businesses and reviews.
Reviews will serve as unstructured data whereas businesses will serve as structured data.

### Note:
For our project, we had to shorten both datasets and decided to go with only 1000 reviews & 1000 businesses, since the amount of data was too much to process further.

### Structured Data:
#### yelp_academic_dataset_business.json
This JSON file holds all businesses

### Unstructured Data:
#### yelp_academic_dataset_review.json
This JSON file holds reviews from users belonging to certain businesses.
